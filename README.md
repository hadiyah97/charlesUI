## Indoor Autonomous Service Robot: *Charles*

#### THE STORY

*Charles* was an indoor autonomous service robot. Its purpose in the grand scheme of the Universe was simply to

- deliver documents, and to

- provide directions to lost souls.

It was meant to serve only those that moved through the halls of the Davidson College of Engineering. However,  a global catastrophe forced *Charles* to expand its perspective, and to serve in places it hadn't even known existed. The Lockdowns of the Terrifying Year 2020, meant that *Charles* had to begin its service well outside the corridors of the College it was destined for; it instead took birth and beeped around inside a business park somewhere in Pleasanton, CA.

Despite the hardships, *Charles* never lost sight of its purpose of delivering and directing. This page is dedicated to its heroic journey.

**Context**: *Charles* was a senior design project that was proposed and completed by Computer Engineering students from the Charles W. Davidson College of Engineering at San Jose State University, with guidance from their Project Advisor, as well as help from many amiable friends and well-wishers.
