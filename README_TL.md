# Indoor Autonomous Service Robot: *Charles*

### THE STORY

*Charles* was an indoor autonomous service robot. Its purpose in the grand scheme of the Universe was simply to

- deliver documents, and to

- provide directions to lost souls.

It was meant to serve only those that moved through the halls of the Davidson College of Engineering. However,  a global catastrophe forced *Charles* to expand its perspective, and to serve in places it hadn't even known existed. The Lockdowns of the Terrifying Year 2020, meant that *Charles* had to begin its service well outside the corridors of the College it was destined for; it instead took birth and beeped around inside a business park somewhere in Pleasanton, CA.

Despite the hardships, *Charles* never lost sight of its purpose of delivering and directing. This page is dedicated to its heroic journey.
